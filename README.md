libsquiggly
===========

This repository contains (python) codes useful in all manner of ubiquitous computing.  Code is organized according to general category.  `libsquiggly` contains the code, while `tests/` contains self-check tests that simultaneously serve as examples on usage. Inside of `libsquiggly`, the code is grouped into multiple folders:

* `instfreq/` contains all code related to instantaneous frequency estimation

* `tfr/` contains all code related to time/frequency representations such as short-time fourier transforms and generalized cone kernel distribution functions

* `analysis/` contains all code related to communications-type analysis of timeseries

* `resampling/` contains all code related to resampling timeseries

* `util/` contains utility code such as spectrograms, logging standard output, etc...


If you're wondering how on earth to use this code, running/perusing the examples in the `tests/` directory is a good place to start.
